# web-scraping-chanllenge2


I built a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to 
the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page.
I created a jupyter notebook with the scraping code and tested it there.
Then moved that code to a .py file using visual studio.
I also created an .html file to create the website and a scrape file to make the calls.

There are .png files of photos of the final web page.
New Repository because first one had problems
